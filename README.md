# How do you gif today?

This project is a search engine that consumes data from GIPHY API and that hopes to help you find a gif for each day. It doesn't matter what mood you have!

Well, to be honest with you it is another thing! It's a ***little*** project with which I have learned to use react hooks, custom hooks and some CSS animations.

You can see it in action here:

🚀 Props up, props down!

🚀 CSS Animations
